Roadmap to Mastering Java Streams
- [ ] **Introduction to Streams** - Learn what streams are and their benefits over traditional collections.
- [ ] **Creating Streams** - Practice creating streams from different data sources (e.g., collections, arrays).
- [ ] **Intermediate Operations** - Implement basic operations like `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `sorted`, and `distinct`.
- [ ] **Terminal Operations** - Learn how to use terminal operations like `collect`, `reduce`, and `forEach`.
- [ ] **Handling Optional** - Understand how to use `Optional` with streams for handling null values.
- [ ] **Grouping and Partitioning** - Explore advanced operations like `groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`, and `mapping`.
- [ ] **Parallel Streams** - Experiment with parallel streams for concurrent processing of data.
- [ ] **Advanced Stream Operations** - Master operations like `joining`, `reducing`, and custom collectors.
- [ ] **Functional Interfaces** - Understand key functional interfaces (`Function`, `Predicate`, `Consumer`, etc.) used in stream operations.
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Learn strategies for error handling in stream operations.
- [ ] **Applying Streams in Projects** - Integrate streams into your existing Java projects to solve practical problems.
- [ ] **Refactoring with Streams** - Refactor code to replace loops with streams where appropriate.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Study best practices for optimizing stream performance, especially with large datasets.
- [ ] **Review and Refinement** - Regularly review your stream code, seek feedback, and refactor for improvement.
